My name is Lukas aka Luke nice to meet you stranger. I studied Applied Computer Science, worked as a Sales & Supply Support Specialist, and did a Full Stack Development course at Le Wagon.

Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I am easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I am passionate about Backend Development, Cyber Security, Typography and have a natural ability to entertain and inspire. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. This passion always leads me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that help me to do better work. I am never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
